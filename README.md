# VSEOSS
Varun Singh Educational Open-Source Series: A series of open source web applications intended to help students be introduced to difficult concepts.

Current Projects being worked on include:

# PhySim
A Newtonian physics simulator. Ultimately, the project is intended to be used by introductory physics students to help them visualize basic simulations and see relevant calculations.

# Sorter
A visualizer for basic computer science sorting algorithms.  Version history txt file supplies intended algorithms to be included.

Important details of the projects implementation include:  
-Each conceptual algorithm and/or data structure is contained in its own JS file. This is modeled after the Java programming language as it is considered a relatively simple and easy method of seperating different concepts, even for beginners.  
-Furthermore, the code found in the JS files is not reflective of a true, practical method of writing these algorithms. Instead, they are optimized for this specific enviroment of seperation between each step. Essentially, they are all the same in terms of function names. The primary differences rise in function bodies.
